For solve the problem I follow some steps:-

Create Python Virtual Environments(Windows)
There virtualenv is a tool to create python environment.
	
1. Install virtualenv via pip:
	\>pip install virtualenv

2. Create a virtual environment
	\>mydir project_folder
	\>cd project_folder
	\project_folder>virtualenv project
	\project_folder>cd project/Scripts
	\project_folder\project\Scripts>activate
	(project) \project_folder\project\Scripts>
	
3. There I copy the dependencies into an empty file in (.txt) formet and placed that file into project folder

4. Now run that file using pip
	(project) \project_folder\project\Scripts>cd ..
	(project) \project_folder\project>pip install -r "Dependencies.txt"
	
Now all Dependencies will start for download.
